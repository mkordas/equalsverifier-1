# EqualsVerifier #

`EqualsVerifier` can be used in Java unit tests to verify whether the contract for the `equals` and `hashCode` methods in a class is met. The contracts are described in the Javadoc comments for the `java.lang.Object` class.


## What's new? ##
I'm in the process of moving EqualsVerifier away from Google Code.

The homepage, including all documentation, has moved to http://www.jqno.nl/equalsverifier. Sorry for the inconvenience!

If you got here through an EqualsVerifier error message, please update to the latest version. It will send you to the correct page directly.

You can find the source code at [GitHub](https://github.com/jqno/equalsverifier). The issue tracker is still here, but will at some point be moved to GitHub as well.
